A new interpretation of the Signals&Slots concept from [Wosser1sProductions/Signals](https://github.com/Wosser1sProductions/Signals)


  Now with a single class capable of subscribing to Signals/Publishers to receive update notifications with tick(),
  while offering others a subscription as Slots/Subscribers to notify them of an update with emit().


This class will be used by the [ScottyCPU](https://github.com/Wosser1sProductions/ScottyCPU) to connect `Gates` or other components together that are in need of synchronicity.
